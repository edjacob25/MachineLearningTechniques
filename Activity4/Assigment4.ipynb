    "<body><font size=\"3\">Visualising data is a complete field of study with very prominent importance, due to the dificulty of seeing how data behaves, how a model classifies or how a patter covers a percentage of the data just using numbers, to help make it easier for us humans to see these relations several techniques have been proposed throught out the years. For this assignment we explored diffenrent ways to visualize data, from pre-stablished methods to some less common ones. Using diferent datasets each of them with different characteristics we obtained many patterns and then we proceeded to analise their composition and try to obtain the best way for their visualization. Each of the followin sections focuses on the data visualization designs we propose as well as some examples, each with different amounts of attributes. </font></body>"

    "<body><font size=\"3\">For one numerical item, we propose <b>boxplots</b> and <b>violin plots</b>. A box and whisker plot —also called a box plot— displays the five-number summary of a set of data. The five-number summary is the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. In a box plot, we draw a box from the first quartile to the third quartile. A vertical line goes through the box at the median. The whiskers go from each quartile to the minimum or maximum. A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data, it can show the outliers and their values, it can also show if the data is symmetrical, how tightly it is grouped, and if and how the data is skewed. Figure 1 shows the parts of a boxplot, which are covered with our visualization proposal. The boxplots shown in this section were created with <em>matplotlib</em>, for violin plots we used <em>altair</em> library. In both cases, we are using a different fill color for each class.</font></body>\n",

    "<body><font size=\"3\">Boxplots are convenient for comparing summary statistics (such as range and quartiles) but does not let you see variations in the data. For multimodal distributions (those with multiple peaks) this can be particularly limiting. A violin plot is a hybrid of a box plot and a kernel density plot, which shows peaks in the data. Figure 2 shows how the peaks of a violin plot represents the probability. </font></body>\n",
    "\n",
    "<body><font size =\"3\">How to decide between boxplots and violin plots? We suggest boxplots when most of the values are clustered around the median. For a different distribution (e.g. if values are clustered around the minimum and the maximum with nothing in the middle) we suggest violin plots. There exists a visualization that overlays a boxplot to a violin plot, but we considered it not so friendly. The boxplots and violin graphs showed in section 2.1.2 are independent, we show them together in this document in order to compare them.</font></body>\n",

It differs from the standard Sankey diagrams due to the fact that they only flow forward representing changes in group composition between attributes. The data in this diagrams is grouped into flows that can easily be traced, this proves very useful for data visualisation.</font></body>\n",

The connections between the blocks going from left to right, represent how instances split or unify according to the attributes they contain, where the width of the connections show the proportion of instances that move to the next block. E.g. in figure \\ref{fig:attr1} we can see the diagram of a pattern obtained from a data-set that separates \\textit{poisonous} from \\textit{non poisonous} mushrooms, the pattern is compose by one attribute ('odor') and it covers about 55\\% of the instances labelled as poisonous of the data. The green flux shows those instances that are covered by the pattern while the grey flux represents those instances that are not covered by the pattern.</font></body>"
