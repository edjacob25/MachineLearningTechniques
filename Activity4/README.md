# Requirements

Our report is in a jupyter notebook with python code, which means that Python, in specific, version 3.7 or above, along with jupyter notebook or jupyter lab are hard requirements for it to function. 

The required libraries are described in `requierments.txt`, all of which we recommend to install in a Python virtual environment.

# Running

Once the notebook is open, you can run the cells sequantially to get all of the outputs again. Some of the plots are required to be exported as html and are not easily embedded, so we output some files wich can be seen in another tab in the chosen browser.

Some of the code is in a module called `create_table.py` and is loaded by the notebook when required, so do not delete this file.

All of the used datasets are in the `Data` folder.
